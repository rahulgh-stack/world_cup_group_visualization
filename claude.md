Based on the document, here's how the groups for the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be created:
Draw Process:

The draw will take place in December 2025
Potential venues include Las Vegas and Washington, D.C.
48 teams will be allocated into four pots based on the FIFA Men's World Ranking of November/December 2025

Pot Structure:

Pot 1: The three co-hosts (Mexico, Canada, United States) plus the best 9 teams by ranking

Mexico is pre-assigned to position A1
Canada is pre-assigned to position B1
United States is pre-assigned to position D1


Pot 2: The next best 12 teams by ranking
Pot 3: The next 12 teams by ranking
Pot 4: The 6 lowest-ranked teams, plus 6 placeholders for:

2 inter-confederation playoff winners
4 UEFA playoff winners



Important Notes:

The four UEFA playoff winners and two inter-confederation playoff winners won't be known at the time of the draw, as these matches are scheduled for March 2026
Teams will be drawn into 12 groups of 4 teams each
Group assignments for specific matches will be determined after the final draw
Stadiums have already been pre-assigned to specific groups, but match pairings will be allocated after the draw

This setup ensures geographic distribution while maintaining competitive balance through the ranking-based pot system.
