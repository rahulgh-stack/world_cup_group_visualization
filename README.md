# FIFA World Cup 2026 Group Stage Draw Simulator

A comprehensive FIFA World Cup 2026 group stage draw simulator based on realistic qualification scenarios, current FIFA rankings, and official tournament rules.

## 📝 Key Assumptions

**Team Selection Methodology**: This simulator uses the 13 currently qualified teams plus 29 additional teams selected through a combination of realistic qualification projections and FIFA ranking-based selection. Non-qualified teams were chosen by analyzing current group standings in each confederation and selecting the highest-ranked teams most likely to qualify based on their competitive positions and historical performance.

**Playoff Participants**: UEFA playoff teams include group runners-up and Nations League backup teams based on realistic scenarios where higher-ranked teams may finish second in competitive groups. Inter-confederation playoff teams represent the most probable candidates from each confederation's qualification pathway.
